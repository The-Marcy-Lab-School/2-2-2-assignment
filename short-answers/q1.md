# Question
Say I have a form on a page with an input for a user's email and password. When you click the submit button, suddenly the url goes from:

```plaintext
https://localhost:8000/
```
to this:
```plaintext
https://localhost:8000/?email=tom%40gmail.com&password=123456
```

The whole page refreshed as well. Why did that happen, and how can we stop it?
